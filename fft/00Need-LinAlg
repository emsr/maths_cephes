	You need LinAlg 4.3 to compile this FFT v1.2 package

Download LinAlg.tar.gz from the same place you got fft.tar.gz

Make sure the version of the LinAlg package is 4.3

Untar LinAlg.tar.gz first, which makes a directory LinAlg

cd LinAlg and untar this fft.tar.gz archive within that directory

Look through the Makefile and make adjustments if necessary
(in compilation flags, standard libraries to link with, etc)

make dist-clean lib check-all

Disregard all compiler warnings
