This program calculates the integrated power radiated, between two
given wavelength limits, by a Planckian black body at given temperature.
Units are degrees Kelvin, watts, and meters.

There are two physical constants that affect the result.
The values used here are
  First radiation constant: c1 = 2 pi h c^2 = 3.741 771 53 (17) e-16 W m2
  Second radiation constant: c2 = h c / k  = 0.014 387 770 (13) m K
These are the 2010 SI values quoted by the Bureau of
Standards (NIST).

Before attempting to compile the program, edit mconf.h to indicate
whether your computer's numbers are big-endian (e.g. Sun sparcstation)
or little-endian (e.g. IBM PC).

Rather than try to second-guess the features or bugs of your system's math
library, all necessary mathematical function subroutines have been
included here.  You can of course use your own math library if you want.
