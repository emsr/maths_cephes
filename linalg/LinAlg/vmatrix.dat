		Verify Basic operations on Matrices


---> Test allocation and compatibility check
The following matrices have been allocated

Matrix 1:4x1:20 Matrix m1 is not engaged

Matrix 1:4x1:20 Matrix m2 is not engaged

Matrix 1:4x0:19 Matrix m3 is not engaged

Matrix 1:4x1:20 Matrix m4 is not engaged

Status information reported for matrix m3:
  Row lower bound ... 1
  Row upper bound ... 4
  Col lower bound ... 0
  Col upper bound ... 19
  No. rows ...........4
  No. cols ...........20
  No. of elements ....80
  Name Matrix m3

Check matrices 1 & 2 for compatibility
Check matrices 1 & 4 for compatibility
m2 has to be compatible with m3 after resizing to m3
m1 has to be compatible with m5 after resizing to m5

Matrix 1:5x1:25 Matrix m5 is not engaged

Done


---> Test operations that treat each element uniformly
Writing zeros to m...
Creating zero m1 ...
Comparing m1 with 0 ...
Writing a pattern 8.625 by assigning to m(i,j)...
Writing the pattern by assigning to m1 as a whole ...
Comparing m and m1 ...
Comparing (m=0) and m1 ...
Clearing m1 ...

Clear m and add the pattern
   add the doubled pattern with the negative sign
   subtract the tripled pattern with the negative sign

Verify comparison operations when all elems are the same

Verify comparison operations when not all elems are the same

Assign 2*pattern to m by repeating additions
Assign 2*pattern to m1 by multiplying by two 
Multiply m1 by one half returning it to the 1*pattern

Assign -pattern to m and m1
m = sqrt(sqr(m)); m1 = abs(m1); Now m and m1 have to be the same

Check out to see that sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1
Element (16,8) with value 1 differs the most from what
was expected, 1, though the deviation 1.19209e-07 is small

Done


---> Test Binary Matrix element-by-element operations

Verify assignment of a matrix to the matrix

Adding the matrix to itself, uniform pattern 4.25
  subtracting two matrices ...
  subtracting the matrix from itself
  adding two matrices together

Arithmetic operations on matrices with not the same elements
   adding mp to the zero matrix...

Testing element-by-element multiplications and divisions
   squaring each element with sqr() and via multiplication
   compare (m = pattern^2)/pattern with pattern


Comparison of two Matrices:
	Original matrix and matrix after squaring and dividing
Matrix 2:11x0:19  is not engaged

Matrix 2:11x0:19  is not engaged

Maximal discrepancy    		0
   occured at the point		(2,0)
 Matrix 1 element is    		4.25
 Matrix 2 element is    		4.25
 Absolute error v2[i]-v1[i]		0
 Relative error				0

||Matrix 1||   			850
||Matrix 2||   			850
||Matrix1-Matrix2||				0
||Matrix1-Matrix2||/sqrt(||Matrix1|| ||Matrix2||)	0

Done
