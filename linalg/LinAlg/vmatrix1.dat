		Verify less trivial Operations on Matrices

---> Verify norm calculations

Assign 10.25 to all the elements and check norms
  1. (col) norm should be pattern*nrows
  Inf (row) norm should be pattern*ncols
  Square of the Eucl norm has got to be pattern^2 * no_elems

Done

---> Check creating some special matrices of dimension 20

test creating Hilbert matrices
test creating zero matrix and copy constructor
test creating unit matrices
check to see that Haar matrix has *exactly* orthogonal columns
make Haar (sub)matrix and test it *is* a submatrix

Done

---> Check making/forcing promises, (lazy)matrices of dimension 20

make a promise and force it by a constructor
make a promise and force it by an assignment

Done

---> Verify matrix transpose
for matrices of a characteristic size 20

Check to see that a square UnitMatrix' stays the same
Test a non-square UnitMatrix
Check to see that a symmetric (Hilbert)Matrix' stays the same
Check transposing a non-symmetric matrix
Check double transposing a non-symmetric matrix
Done


All test passed
